                My name is <b>Roger Vidal</b> and I am a developer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilanova_i_la_Geltr%C3%BA">Vilanova i la Geltr√∫</a>, a city very close to Barcelona (Spain).

                After finishing High School, I decided to study Telecommunications engineering, but after a few months, I realized that it wasn't what I expected. Then, I tried to study Electrical Engineering, but after finishing the second year I decided that I wanted to study something more related to programming and multimedia. At this point, I started a B.E. in Interactive Digital Content, Game and Interactive Media Design.

                When I finished my degree, I started to work in a small startup of game development. In the beginning, we were only three employees, but after a year, we were almost fifteen employees. Also, during this stage, I spent my free time cursing an M.S in Multimedia Applications. After releasing two big projects, we decided to close the company.

                Although my work experience is focused on Web Development, I don't like to consider myself a web developer. In my opinion, the most important ability of a programmer is to be able to research and learn every time you code, because you have a good base. With this, you can swap between code disciplines, and every day you can learn something new.

                I would consider myself a sport passionate and I've been practicing all kinds of sports since a very young age. During all my life, I have combined Roller Hockey and Skiing. I played Roller Hockey for more than 20 years, including a short stage playing in the maximum category ("Ok Lliga"), considered the best league in the world. Playing all this time on a team-based sport has been very useful to me in working with other people.

                In my spare time, apart from practicing sport, I love spending time with friends and family doing any crazy plans. On the other hand, when I'm alone, I love to watch TV Shows and movies, and recently I have discovered a passion to read any kind of fantasy book.
